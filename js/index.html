	<H3>Continuous delivery</H3>
	Our seamless GitHub integration means every pull request spins up a disposable Review App for testing, and any repo can be set up to auto-deploy with every GitHub push to a branch of your choosing. Customize your stack with a Heroku innovation: Buildpacks. Build your own, or choose one from the hundreds built by the community to run Gradle, Meteor, NGINX — even Haskell.
